PAPER ANALYSIS REPORT
=====================

FILE CLASSIFICATION
-------------------
Filename: paper.tex
Type: LaTeX Source Document
Content: Research Paper Draft
Subject: Smart Agriculture / Edge AI System for Wildlife Intrusion Detection

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-------------------
This file contains the source code and content for a research paper titled:
"Design and Implementation of a Multi-Layered Edge AI System for Wild Animal Intrusion Detection and Deterrence in Agriculture"

The paper proposes a low-cost, IoT-based perimeter surveillance system designed specifically for protecting 1-acre farmlands in Tamil Nadu from wild boar attacks. It details a system using 16 interconnected sensor nodes that combine motion detection, thermal imaging, and AI computer vision to detect animals and deter them using non-lethal methods (lights and sounds).

2. TECHNICAL SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE (AS DESCRIBED IN THE TEXT)
----------------------------------------------------------
The research describes a highly specific engineering solution:

A. Topology
   - Dual Concentric Rings: An inner ring (14m radius) and outer ring (23m radius).
   - Node Count: 16 nodes total (8 inner, 8 outer).
   - Coverage: Overlapping fields of view to minimize blind spots.

B. Hardware Stack (Per Node)
   - Microcontroller: ESP32-CAM.
   - Sensors: 
     1. HC-SR502 PIR (Motion trigger, wake-up).
     2. Melexis MLX90640 (Thermal array for heat verification).
     3. OV2640 Camera (Visual confirmation).
   - Power: Solar + 18650 Li-ion batteries.

C. AI & Software
   - Model: Quantized YOLOv3-tiny (<300 KB).
   - Framework: TensorFlow Lite Micro.
   - Function: On-device classification of wild boars vs. other movements.
   - Logic: "Majority-rule voting" (requires agreement from 2+ sensors).

D. Telecommunications
   - Local: LoRa P2P (Peer-to-Peer) for node-to-node cross-verification.
   - Uplink: LoRaWAN Class A for sending alerts to the cloud.

E. Deterrence (Response)
   - Level 1: IR Floodlight + Siren.
   - Level 2: Ultrasonic sweeping + Strobe lights.
   - Level 3: Alert to human via mobile app.

3. LATEX DOCUMENT STRUCTURE ANALYSIS
-----------------------------------
The file is a standard article-class LaTeX document designed for academic submission.

A. Formatting
   - Class: \documentclass[12pt,a4paper]{article}
   - Packages: Uses standard academic packages including 'times' (font), 'geometry' (margins), 'graphicx' (images), and 'cite' (references).
   - Customization: Defines custom headers for Section and Subsection titles using \titleformat.

B. Key Sections Defined
   - Abstract & Keywords
   - Introduction: Problem statement regarding human-wildlife conflict.
   - Methods and Methodology: Details the sensing layer, edge AI, and networking.
   - Results and Cost Analysis: Contains placeholders for graphs and a detailed cost table.
   - Conclusion & Acknowledgement.
   - References: Currently contains a dummy/placeholder reference (to a cancer biology paper) which needs to be replaced.

4. DEPENDENCIES & MISSING ELEMENTS
---------------------------------
To compile this file successfully, the following external files are required in a 'data/' subdirectory:
   - data/detection_comparison.png
   - data/p2p_overhead.png
   - data/latency_cdf.png

5. COST ESTIMATION HIGHLIGHTS
----------------------------
The paper includes a specific economic analysis:
- Cost per node: ~7,710 INR
- Total setup implementation (Year 1): ~1,83,008 INR
- Recurring cost: ~27,200 INR/year

6. ACTION ITEMS FOR COMPLETION
-----------------------------
To finalize this paper, the following placeholders need attention:
- Author Details: Currently "First Author Name", "Author's Affiliation".
- References: The bibliography contains a placeholder item about "Tissue invasion and metastasis" which is irrelevant to agriculture/IoT.
- Images: Ensure the referenced PNG files exist in the 'data' folder.
